Checkpoint 5
Checkpoint Problem 1: All Unique Permutations


Given a collection of numbers that might contain duplicates, return all possible unique permutations.


Example :


[1,1,2] have the following unique permutations:


[1,1,2]
[1,2,1]
[2,1,1]

NOTE : No 2 entries in the permutation sequence should be the same.


Warning : DO NOT USE LIBRARY FUNCTION FOR GENERATING PERMUTATIONS.


Example: next_permutations in C++ / itertools.permutations in python. If you do, we will disqualify your submission retroactively and give you penalty points.


NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead, return values as specified. Still have a doubt? Check out Sample Code for more details.

Checkpoint Problem 2: Longest Consecutive Sequence


Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.


Example:


Given [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2], The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Return its length: 4


Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.


NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead, return values as specified. Still have a doubt? Check out Sample Code for more details.
